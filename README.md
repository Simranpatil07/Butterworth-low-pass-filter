# Butterworth-low-pass-filter

In image processing (IPMV), a Butterworth low-pass filter (BLPF) is a frequency domain filter used for smoothing images, reducing noise, and preserving low-frequency components by attenuating high-frequency noise. 
In the field of Image Processing, Butterworth Lowpass Filter (BLPF) is used for image smoothing in the frequency domain. It removes high-frequency noise from a digital image and preserves low-frequency components.
